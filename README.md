👋 Hi, I’m @daydone, an experienced server and infrastructure technician with a passion for DevOps engineering.

👀 I’m interested in AWS, Python, and Automation, and I'm currently building my skills in these areas.

🌱 I’m always learning and currently focused on AWS, Python, and AI, and exploring how they can be used to improve infrastructure efficiency and automation.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects where I can apply my skills and learn from others.

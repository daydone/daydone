👋 Hi, I’m @daydone, I build things.

I am an experienced infrastructure engineer with a passion for DevOps, AWS, Python, AI, and Automation, and I'm currently building my skills in these areas.

🌱 I’m always learning and currently focused on AWS, Python, and AI, and exploring how they can be used to improve infrastructure efficiency and automation.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects where I can apply my skills and learn from others.

📫 You can reach me at finbaroday@gmail.com to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities.
